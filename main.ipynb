    "I need to do the following work:\n",
    "1. **Pull PENDLEUSDT and USDTUSDC binance data.** I need PENDLE<>USDC Binance prices because the Uniswap pools are PENDLE<>USDC. \n",
    "2. **Use Polars to join data on second to produce PENDLEUSDC pricing with second-level granularity.** We use Google BQ, and I don't think I can join on second-level data in GoogleBQ. The plan is to join the data in Polars with second-level granularity."
